## About
A Full Stack Music Product that takes inspiration from Spotify to show off my love for hard rock classics like AC/DC, Metallica and Guns N' Roses! This Project leveraged Next.js, React.js, TailwindCSS, Typescript, Stripe API, and Supabase (PostgreSQL) for the database!

## Features
- Personal Account Creation taking advantage of a Stripe Subsciption Model 
- Like Songs to add to your 'liked' playlist
- Search Songs that have been added to the database
- Upload your own songs to your library
- Functionality to Stop / Play, Skip Forwards & Skip Backwards, and Adjust Volume in Browser
- Newest Songs Section to Showcase Recent Uploads from all users

## Setup
1) Before Playing any music or uploading songs, user must create an account on the platform.
2) Once Account is created, clicking on music will redirect user to Stripe to 'subscribe' before accessing any features of the service.
   (PUT IN FAKE CARD INFORMATION)
4) Stripe sometimes logs out users when 'subscribing', just sign back into the platform to have full access once authenticated!

## Disclaimers
- This Project takes advantage of Stripe API to simulate a subscription service of $8 a Month. This isn't a real service nor are there any real charges happening on Stripe. Just put in fake card information to bypass Stripe and gain full access. Stripe Integration was only for educational purposes to learn about APIs and SaaS Products.
